# Getting Started

To get started using this application locally:

* First things first, clone the github repo into any directory on your system
* Open that cloned repo in an IDE of your choice
* Next, cd into the backend server and type the command  "npm install" into the terminal.
* After, cd into the frontend folder and also type the command "npm install" into the terminal.
* Once both of those are complete, make sure to type "npm start" into both the front end terminal and back end terminal
to start both servers and allow them to communicate
* After that is complete, a window in your default browser will open to the front page of the application!
* Done, have fun!
